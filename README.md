# Standard_RL_Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of some of the standard deep reinforcement learning algorithms, divided in discrete and continous action spaces. For the sake of practice, I compared performance on the OpenAI cartpole environment, for the algorithms implemented on the discrete action space. However, this is no accurate comparison since I did not run any thorough hyper-parameter search for each algorithms, nor have I compared performance across multiple random seeds (i.e. all performance based on a single random seed).
